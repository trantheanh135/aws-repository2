1. Scan infrastructure as code templates
- We can use Checkov for scan. It is for analyzing static codes for IaC. To detect cloud misconfigurations, it scans your cloud infrastructure, which is managed in Kubernetes, Terraform, and Cloudformation.
     
- Example: Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket is securely encrypted at rest


2. Scan AMI’s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
- Use Anchore or Clair

Example: [INFO] ▶ Start clair-scanner
[INFO] ▶ Server listening on port 9279
[INFO] ▶ Analyzing 693bdf455e7bf0952f8a4539f9f96aa70c489ca239a7dbed0afb481c87cbe131
[CRIT] ▶ Image contains unapproved vulnerabilities: [CVE-2016-9840 CVE-2016-9841 CVE-2016-9842 CVE-2016-9843]

3. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
- AWS SecurityHub

Example: Ensure credentials unused for 90 days or greater are disabled.
Ensure IAM password policy requires at least one symbol

1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

- We could disable or limit the SSH access to the web application.

2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

- It doesn't prevent unauthorized access.

3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

- The default encryption doesn't affect the data already in the S3. The data must be reupload to the S3, so the data could be affect. So set up encryption from the start is important

4. What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

- In the next cloud formation stack deployment, the changes will impact.
